After checking from the Azure portal, we confirmed that the VM is currently running normally. The Resource Health status shows the VM as Available with no signs of reboots or downtime.

It seems there was a mismatch between the Availability metrics and Resource Health data. This can happen occasionally due to temporary delays in data collection, network latency, or other short-term monitoring issues. As a result availability metrics might briefly show downtime even when the VM is healthy leading to false alerts.

We also confirmed that there are no active service issues in any Azure regions.

This behavior is due to the way Linux repositories classify updates—it varies from server to server. In some cases, even security-related patches (like for grub) may appear under the ""Other"" classification if the repository does not properly tag them.

Additionally, some repositories might include both security and third-party patches under a single classification, which causes further inconsistency in how Azure detects and categorizes them.

To address this, we recommend enabling the ""Other"" classification in Azure Update Manager. This will ensure that all relevant patches, including third-party and misclassified security updates, are considered during deployment.

As discussed, after reviewing the Kerberos configuration (/etc/krb5.conf), I confirmed it was correctly set for our Active Directory domain, XDXINC.NET, including the appropriate encryption types, DNS lookup, and accurate domain-to-realm mappings. However, the host was not joined initially due to a missing authentication file.

We received a VM Availability alert for vm-mappro-mms-1-prod. However upon investigation we found that the VM is currently up and running. The Resource Health status is marked as Available and there are no signs of reboots or downtime.

We suspect a glitch between the VM availability metrics and Resource Health data from Azure. This may be due to temporary delays in metric collection or reporting on Azure's end, where the availability metric may indicate downtime while Resource Health continues to show the VM as available. Such inconsistencies can occasionally trigger false alerts possibly due to transient monitoring issues or network latency.

Additionally, no active service issues were observed all regions are reporting as healthy.

As no actual impact was observed, we will proceed with closing the ticket for now.

We received a VM Availability alert for vm-mappro-hybrid-worker-prod. However, upon investigation we found that the VM is currently up and running. The Resource Health status is marked as Available and there are no signs of reboots or downtime.
 
We suspect a glitch between the VM availability metrics and Resource Health data from Azure. This may be due to temporary delays in metric collection or reporting on Azure's end, where the availability metric may indicate downtime while Resource Health continues to show the VM as available. Such inconsistencies can occasionally trigger false alerts possibly due to transient monitoring issues or network latency.
 
Additionally, no active service issues were observed all regions are reporting as healthy.
 
As no actual impact was observed, we will proceed with closing the ticket for now.

We received an availability alert for the VM azpwprdslimapp1.

After checking from the Azure portal, we confirmed that the VM is currently running normally. The Resource Health status shows the VM as Available with no signs of reboots or downtime.

It seems there was a mismatch between the Availability metrics and Resource Health data. This can happen occasionally due to temporary delays in data collection, network latency, or other short-term monitoring issues. As a result availability metrics might briefly show downtime even when the VM is healthy leading to false alerts.

We also confirmed that there are no active service issues in any Azure regions.
